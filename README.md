## Hi there 👋

Hi! I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo who loves learning and trying new things. I've explored brainwave processing, computer graphics, and desktop applications, and more.

I'm highly experienced in full-stack web development. My main tech stacks are React, Svelte, TailwindCSS, JS/TS, Firebase, Flask, and Express.js.

Take a look at some of my *many* hackathon projects [here](https://devpost.com/Previouslynamedjeff) (please just don't read the code 😊).

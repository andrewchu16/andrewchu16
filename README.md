## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi! I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo who loves learning and trying new things. I've explored brainwave processing, computer graphics, RAG pipelines, and more.

I'm highly experienced in full-stack web development. My main tech stacks are React, SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, JS/TS, Firebase, Flask, and Express.js.

Take a look at some of my 20+ hackathon projects [here](https://devpost.com/Previouslynamedjeff) and [here](https://dorahacks.io/hacker/U_977fd1e781eb14).
